What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery.


CI:
Continuous build + continuous testing.


Work Flow of Jenkins:
----------------------------
-> We can attach git, maven, selenium & artifictory plugins to jenkins.
-> Once developers puts code in github, jenkins pulls the code & sends to maven for build.
-> Once build is done, jenkins pulls that code and send to selenium for testing.
-> Once testing is done, jenkins will pull that code and send to artifactory (archive, finished code) as per the requirnment and so on.
-> At last deploy the code in QA or PROD env.
